* If you can solve a problem with how you shape your component hierarchy or state - do that first.
* Memoization is a solid strategy only if the cost of checking pays for itself with the time you save rendering.
* Using the Suspense API to progressively load your application is a good idea. And, more good stuff will come soon.
* The Transition API is there for you when you're really in a pickle.
