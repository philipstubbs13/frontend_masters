## Exercises

Exercises are separated by directory. The first lesson is at [`01/index.js`](./01/index.js). Each directory will contain a `README.md` describing the goal of the exercise, as well as tips and comments in the `index.js` file.

If you get lost, refer to the `index.final.js` file in each directory.

To navigate to a rendered exercise in the browser, change the directory in the URL (`http://localhost:1234/[dir]/index.html`). The first lesson is located at [http://localhost:1234/00/index.html](http://localhost:1234/01/index.html).
