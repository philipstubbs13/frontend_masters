# Exercise 08 - Delayed Transitions

## Goals

Ensure that you can't drag the box for more than 2 seconds.

## Tips

- Use a delayed transition via `after: { ... }` to transition back to `idle` from `dragging` after 2 seconds.
- Parameterize the 2 second timeout.

## Extra Credit

- How would you make the timeout configurable from the `context` instead?
