# Exercise 09 - Hierarchical States

## Goals

When the <kbd>shift</kbd> key is pressed while dragging, we want the `#box` to only move on the X-axis.

## Tips

- Use hierarchical (nested) states in `dragging`. What nested states would you have?
- One state is for normal behavior, another is for locked behavior. How would these states transition between each other?

## Extra Credit

- Can you do something similar for the Y-axis? Naturally, we can't lock on the X-axis and Y-axis at the same time.
