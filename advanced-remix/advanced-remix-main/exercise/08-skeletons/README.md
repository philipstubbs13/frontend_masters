# 08. Skeletons

## 📝 Notes

## 🤓 Background

A loading spinner is great... But we can improve that experience even further by
offering what's called a skeleton UI. This improves the user's perceived
performance because they can instantly see some response from the application
and can start acclimating themselves to the new UI while you're loading the
data. This is especially useful if you have some part of the UI that takes a bit
of time to the load, but the rest is already there.

With nested routing, this is pretty straightforward as well. You simply
determine whether you're in a loading state and instead of showing the
`<Outlet />` you show the `<Skeleton />` component. Doing this means that the
user is no longer looking at the old data, but instead at the skeleton UI.

Another thing you'll need to know is how to pass information from one location
to another. The browser's `history` API supports `state` which can do this (📜
learn more about
[`history.state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/state)).
You can do this with the `Link` (and `NavLink`) component via the `state` prop
and access that value via `transition.location.state`.

## 💪 Exercise

When we're on the customer page navigating between customers, we want to show a
skeleton UI instead of just the spinner in the corner to improve the UX. We've
already built a skeleton component for you. Your job is to use
`useTransition().location.state` to determine which customer we're transitioning
to and display the skeleton component while we load the rest of the data.
