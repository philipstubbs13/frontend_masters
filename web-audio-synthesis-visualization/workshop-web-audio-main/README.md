# Just Starting Out

This workshop assumes you are comfortable with JavaScript and ES6 syntax, and instead focuses just on the audio side of things. If you're new to JavaScript, you might want to begin your journey below:

- [JavaScript For Cats](http://jsforcats.com/)

Also great is Daniel Shiffman's video series, which often uses p5.js:

- [Programming from A to Z](https://shiffman.net/a2z/)

A more comprehensive guide on the JavaScript language can be found here:

- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)

And here's a useful cheat sheet to use as a reference:

- [Interactive JavaScript Cheat Sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/)

# Code Snippets

I've also included a small "recipes" document that you can use as a reference if you are forgetting some of the patterns and recipes discussed during the workshop.

- [Code Snippets](./docs/snippets.md)

# Setup

If you want to run locally (without internet), clone this repo into a new folder, then use Node.js to cd into the folder and run the following to install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Now, start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

Edit files in `src/js` and see them reflected in the browser.
