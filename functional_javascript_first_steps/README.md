* pure functions
  * only input in
  * only output out
  * a function that does not have any side effects.
* Why functional programming?
  * more predictable, safer
  * easier to test/debug
* Why functional JavaScript?
  * object-oriented JS gets tricky
  * (prototypes? this?!?)
  * established community and tools.
* Avoid side effects
  * do nothing but return output based on nothing but input.
* Recursion
* Tail Call Optimization
* Proper Tail Calls
* first class functions
  * can be passed around as values (like callbacks)
* higher order functions
  * take other functions as input/output
* Remember: Don't loop
  * use higher-order functions like map, reduce, filter instead.
