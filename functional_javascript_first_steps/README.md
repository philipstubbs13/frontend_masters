* pure functions
  * only input in
  * only output out
  * a function that does not have any side effects.
* Why functional programming?
  * more predictable, safer
  * easier to test/debug
* Why functional JavaScript?
  * object-oriented JS gets tricky
  * (prototypes? this?!?)
  * established community and tools.
* Avoid side effects
  * do nothing but return output based on nothing but input.
