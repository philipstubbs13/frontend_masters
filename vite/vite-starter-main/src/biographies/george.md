# George Harrison

George Harrison, born on February 25, 1943, in Liverpool, was the lead guitarist of The Beatles and often referred to as the "quiet Beatle." Although overshadowed by Lennon and McCartney, Harrison contributed several classic songs to the band's repertoire, including "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," "Something," and "Here Comes the Sun." He was also instrumental in introducing Indian classical music and spiritualism to the Western world. After the Beatles broke up, Harrison had a successful solo career and was also involved in film production. He passed away on November 29, 2001, due to lung cancer.
