* Executing JavaScript Code
  * Code is saved (defined) in functions - to be run later.
  * As soon as we start running our code, we create a global execution context.
  * Thread of execution (parsing and executng the code line after line)
  * Live memory of variables with data (know as a Global Variable Environment)
