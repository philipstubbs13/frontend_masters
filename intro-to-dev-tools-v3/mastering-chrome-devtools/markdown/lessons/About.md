- [A walk through the panels](#a-walk-through-the-panels)
- [The course format](#course-format)

Chrome DevTools can do so many things. Sometimes it's more important to know what a tool can do than knowing exactly how to do it!

<div class="note">💡 Note: Chrome extensions often mess with the DevTools data, leading to inaccurate reporting! If you're going to run any important audits, make sure you have all of your extensions disabled **or** use an Incognito tab!</div>
