# Step Through Debugging

If you've programmed in another language, step through debugging may already be familiar to you! But we'll cover it here for the folks that haven't seen it before.

The basic idea is that you can pick a line in your code and highlight it. Whenever that line is about to be executed, the browser will instead **pause** the execution of the app. Leaving you free to poke around in it's current state for as long as you'd like.

Think about breakpoints like a ultra powerful `console.log`! Instead of just printing out a single expression, you can spend unlimited time logging unlimited expressions in a stateless environment.

In this lesson we'll learn how to:

- Set and activate breakpoints
- Use the `debugger` keyword
- Walk the call stack
- Set conditional breakpoints
- Set XHR breakpoints
