CHAPTER 5: APPLY CALC/CUSTOM PROPERTIES TO HOME LAYOUT

BOOM goes Bootstrap!!!

Check the chapter 5 folder for comps for how the site should look at extra large, large, medium, and small dimensions.

Use Flexbox, calc(), and custom properties to complete this task.

A good place to start is the chapter 4 answer. Remember that we had this logic:

.row {
	margin: 0;
	display: flex;
	flex-flow: row wrap;
	justify-content: space-between;
	--columns: 4;
}
[class*="col-"] {
  --width: 4;
  --initialbasis: calc(var(--width, 0) / var(--columns, 4) * 100%);
  --gap: calc((var(--columns) - var(--width)) * 1%);
  flex-basis: calc(var(--initialbasis) - var(--gap));
}

In your case, do the following:

- What is "row" and "col-" in this HTML? Make sure the selectors reflect what you're doing. Remember flex containers/parents and flex items/children -- the relationship is critical!

- The designer said this is a 16-column layout, so let's work with that. What do we need to change?

- What if we want a different size gap?

- What changes in the media queries?


BONUS: Now that you've applied this to the major page layout, could you use this same logic to the developers column and its changes in layout?

There are so many resources for calc, custom properties, Flexbox, and these methodologies, I've listed them on their own page:
