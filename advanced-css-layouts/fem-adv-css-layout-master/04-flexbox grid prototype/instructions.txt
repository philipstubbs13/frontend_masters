CHAPTER 4: FLEXBOX GRID PROTOTYPE

This example should look familiar to you - we coded it several times in the original layouts course.

Take a few minutes to remind yourself of this code. Essentially, we did the following:

- at mobile dimensions, all cells are 92% wide with 4% margin on either side

- at tablet dimensions, some are 44% wide and others are 92% wide

- at desktop dimensions, we have 4 cells across, 2-2, 1-3, 4 (a full row), and a 1-2-1 arrangement, with some ordering in use.

Now we will rewrite the code with calc and custom properties to achieve the following:

- We don't have to repeat ourselves so often in the media queries
- We don't have to use higher math to figure out the total row layout
- We drop margin and work with a flexible gap instead... it is, after all, Flexbox!
