CHAPTER 10: YOU TRY IT RESPONSIVE TABLES

In the "begin" folder, you'll find a new page with some information about the planets.

Apply your new table knowledge to make this table responsive.

HINTS:

- Remember there's PAGE layout and TABLE layout. Both are responsive. The trick here is to combine them so that everything works correctly.

- That means you may need to override some of the "inside" page layout settings to get this to work!

- Suggested approach:

a. Determine where the right column can be next to the table and where it needs to move under the table. Style appropriately in layout.css.

b. Make the table stretch fully across the page as soon as you start to wrap the <aside> underneath the table.

c. When the table no longer stretches across the page, now disassemble it into a report.
