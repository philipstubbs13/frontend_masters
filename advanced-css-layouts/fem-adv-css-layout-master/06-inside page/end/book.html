            <h1><cite>Before You Code</cite>: Product success is part of the plan</h1>
            <img src="img/book.png" alt="Before You Code book cover." class="floatright">
            <p>Your idea is going to be BIG. You just know it. But before you hire your favorite developer to go build it, take a step back. Creating a brand-new product is a risk; many of them fail within their first year. Is there a proven way to set yourself up for success?</p>
            <p>Yes! All it takes is some preparation. By taking the time to do upfront validation, planning and iterating before you build, you can avoid ideas that flop and create a product that exceeds expectations.</p>
            <h2>Execute each lesson using the accompanying workbook</h2>
            <p>Upon purchase you'll receive a confirmation email with instructions on how to download your workbook, as well as a notice when your physical copy has shipped.</p>
            <p>The workbook, an editable PDF file, is essential. It is full of activities and guidance for implementing at every step.</p>
