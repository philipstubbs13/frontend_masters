* Why use typescript?
  - Type checking at compile time is way better than things crashing or worse behaving unexpectedly at run time.
  - You get a better development experience because autocomplete knows more about what you're intending on doing.
  - Large codebases stay more maintainable because you're able to put guardrails on how your code can be used.
