Flexbox Properties

A complete version of these tips with image explanations and links is available at CSS Tricks:

Parent (Flex Container)
	display: flex | inline-flex;

	flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;

	flex-wrap: wrap | nowrap | wrap-reverse;

	flex-flow (shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap) (flex-flow: row wrap;)


These next two properties work similarly, just on their different axes. 

	justify-content (main axis): flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;

	align-items (cross axis): flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;


Align-content spans multiple line boxes. 
	
	align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | stretch | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;



Children (Flex Items)
	order: <integer>;

	flex-grow: <number>; 

	flex-shrink: <number>; 

	flex-basis: <length> | auto;

	flex: shorthand for grow, shrink, and basis (default:  0 1 auto)
	
	align-self: overrides alignment set on parent



Main axis = the axis declared in flex-direction
Cross axis = the other axis

i.e. if flex-flow: row wrap;  

      main axis = row
      cross axis = column

if flex-flow: column nowrap;

       main axis = column
       cross axis = row
