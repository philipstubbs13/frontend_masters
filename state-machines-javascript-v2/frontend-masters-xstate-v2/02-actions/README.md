# 02. Actions

## Goals

- Know what actions are (fire-and-forget effects)
- Know the difference between entry, exit, and transition ("do") actions
- Recognize when an action should be an entry/exit action rather than a transition action
- Know how to implement & parameterize actions in XState

## Exercises

Add the missing actions to the machine. For now, these actions can just be empty functions or `console.log(...)` statements.

You can start by putting the actions inline, and then add them inside `.withConfig` later.
