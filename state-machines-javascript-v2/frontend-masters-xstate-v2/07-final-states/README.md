# 07. Final states

## Goals

- Understand what final states are and what they represent
- Know when to use final states
- Understand what happens when a machine reaches its final state
- Know how to implement final states with XState, including "done data"
- Know how final states work with compound states and "done" transitions
- Know how final states work with parallel states and "done" transitions

## Exercises

Add a `finished` final state so that the logic for the `player` state is more semantic, and so that the transitions can be more natural.
