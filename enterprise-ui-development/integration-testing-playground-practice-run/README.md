# Integration Testing Playground

This is a playground for working with integration tests (using Playwright) for Steve Kinney's Frontend Masters course.

## Getting Set Up

First and foremost, install your dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Next, set up the database.

```
npm run db:setup
```

Finally, spin up the server.

```
npm start
```

Your server will need to be running when you go to run your tests.
