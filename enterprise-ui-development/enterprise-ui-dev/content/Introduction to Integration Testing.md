We're going to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for our integration tests. A lot of the ideas translate over to some of the other browser-testing frameworks.

> \[!NOTE\] What about Cypress?
> If you use [Cypress](https://cypress.io), I did [a whole course on Cypress](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/cypress/) not too long ago. Like I said, a lot of the concepts we're going to talk about in this section apply to Cypress as well, but if you want to go deeper into the specific of _how_ to write Cypress tests, you should totally check that course outâ€”_after_ this one, of course.
