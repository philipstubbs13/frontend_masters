# Packing List: Component Testing Exercise

Take a look at our **Packing List** application in `src/examples/packing-list`.

Can you add tests for the follow:

- Verify that there is an input field for adding a new item.
- Verify that the "Add New Item" button is disabled when the input field is empty.
- Verify that the "Add New Item" button is enabled when there is content in the input field.
- Verify that the new item is added to the page when the "Add New Item" button is clicked.

If you want to go for a victory lap, you can add some tests for the following:

- Verify that the input field is cleared out after clicking "Add New Item."
- Verify that you can remove the item.

**Next**: We'll talk about some [possible solutions](Component%20Testing%20Solution.md).
