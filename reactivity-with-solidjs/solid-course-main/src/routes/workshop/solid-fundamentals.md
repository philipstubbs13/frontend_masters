# Solid Fundamentals

## Learning the Ropes

Now that we have mastered the foundations of reactive primitives, it is time to actually introduce ourselves to writing SolidJS. This section will focus on syntax and APIs you will need to author your Solid applications.

We will focus on 3 key areas:

* Control Flow
* Component Authoring
* DOM bindings

We will alternate between explanation and simple examples from the SolidJS tutorial to learn the basics of the these APIs.
