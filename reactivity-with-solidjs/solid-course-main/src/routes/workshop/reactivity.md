# Reactivity

## What is Reactivity?

Reactivity and Reactive Programming have historically been hard words to nail down to a particular concept. Mostly that Reactivity in software is generally seen as a desirable trait and has described everything from the responsiveness of real-time applications to specific flavors of functional programming.

Today, we look at Reactivity in the framing of UI frameworks. Solid is not alone in delivering the core of its experience with Reactivity. So learning this will also help you use other projects like Vue, MobX, and Svelte.

## Understanding the Foundations

Solid is built on Reactivity so we are going to learn how it works. We will go through basics of Reactivity with simple examples. We will look at the primitives and how they work together.

Once this is understood we will try our hand at building a simple reactive system ourselves.
