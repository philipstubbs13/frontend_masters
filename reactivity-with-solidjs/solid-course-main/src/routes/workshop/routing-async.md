# Routing and Async

## Building a Navigatable Site

We are going to finish our lessons with building a more typical website that leverages common patterns like Server Side Rendering, Routing, and Data fetching.

To do so we are going to leverage Solid's new starter SolidStart.

Stackblitz:

```
https://stackblitz.com/github/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples/bare
```

CLI:

```
> npm init solid solid-hackernews
> cd solid-hackernews
> npm i
> npm run dev
```
