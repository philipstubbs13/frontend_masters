# Frontend Masters + Firebase!

> The source materials and companion site

### Download these first
- [Java 18](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-mac)
- [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/)

### Setup the companion guide

```bash
cd guide
npm i
npm run dev
```

### The course structure
Each section of the course is numered and has it's own accompanying `package.json` to install dependencies and run the demos. Within each section you'll find a `start` and `final` folder showing the beginning code state and then the complete state as well. To run any of these folders:

```bash
# Use whatever section you need
cd ./1-fast-but-not-good-setup/start
npm i
npm run dev
```

#### Happy coding!
